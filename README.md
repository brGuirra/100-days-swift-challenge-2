<h1>Shopping List</h1>

This is the second challenge from Hacking With Swift [100 days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) course.

---

## 💁🏽‍♂️ Overview

This app is a simple shopping list

## ⚙️ How it works

The user type items to insert in the shopping list. It's possible 
clear or share the list 

An item can only be added if it doesn't exist already. The user
can't add an empty value, share or clear an empty list

## 🔨 Built with

- UIKit
- Storyboard

## 🤓 What I learned

I practiced the concepts I saw in the past projects
from the course 

I created all the UI and constraints programmatically
and I also thought about the situations the app should
show errors to the user

I had to solve a problem with the option to share the list
because the UIActivityViewController doesn't accept an array
with Strings
